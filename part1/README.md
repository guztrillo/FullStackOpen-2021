#  Part 1 - Introduction to React

I fineshed another video course about React.JS and I have been working with JavaScript for at least one year. I wanted to start a new challenge where I can put in practice what I've learned so far about JavaScript and React, so I started Full Stack Open 2021. 

It was a weird introduction because they teach you React before JavaScript, but incredibly it works. I think the flow of information was pretty good and learned a couple of details I didn't know. Also, I have to say the exercises were a little tricky in some parts, specially if you are completly newbie. I had to think a little bit harder, specially with the last exercise of this part.

I feel really satisfied so far and I'm looking forward to keep learning and finish the whole course. LET'S GO.
