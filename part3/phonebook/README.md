# Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

The more I practice, the more I find backend easier than frontend. I don't really sure about this, maybe if I dive in Node I will find the problems I ain't facing now so far. I enjoyed this part of the course, a lot of exercesises and practices and now I want to keep practicing backend and develop full stack apps. MongoDB part was really interesting too.
